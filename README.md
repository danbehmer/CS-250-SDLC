How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

One way to interpret user needs for implementation is by going to them directly, and asking what they would like to see added. User stories is one way of how to do this. These take the user's feedback and find ways to implement them into the application. Throughout this course, we were given user stories to implement, some of these included price ranges, profile management, and vacation recommendations based on previous vacations.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

One way that I approach developing programs would be getting an idea of what the user is trying to accomplish, and any of their needs. The utilization of user stories is key to releasing a product that is easy to use, and apprecaited by the user. I plan on incorporating user stories into my future development work.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To me, being a good team member in software development means to be an open communicator. This means keeping my team up to date on what I am working on, why, and what I plan to work on next. This keeps the flow of work steady, which is beneficial for meeting product deadlines.
